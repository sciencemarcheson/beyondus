					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				</header>
				<section class="posts">
					<p>1. Is this group distinct from the Atlanta March for Science?
						<br>The short answer is NO. A number of folks that were involved in the march, started having discussions, in January, on how to build upon the momentum from the march. So, in many ways, this is the natural offshoot to the march. Stay tuned for the organizational structure, working groups, etc. And as before, we need help, so if you are interested, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BkYjxvhpbrfoD7Xt2" class="button special small" style="cursor: pointer;">JOIN US</a>
						<br><br>2. How can I get involved?
						<br><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BkYjxvhpbrfoD7Xt2"><b>JOIN US</b></a>. We are ramping up, and in the coming weeks we will solicit volunteers, ideas and feedback, through multiple channels. Be sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
						for updates.
						<br><br>3. What kind of organization will you be?
						<br>We’re in the process of becoming a 501(c)3. Our chief objectives will be to educate on and advocate for science and data-driven approaches to problems that the state of Georgia faces. We will not be endorsing or even scoring candidates for political
						office, and will remain nonpartisan.
						<br><br>4. What’s the difference between nonpartisan and apolitical?
						<br>Nonpartisan means that we don’t choose one party over another or endorse one party over another. However, this does not mean we can’t be politically involved. For example, a piece of legislation could implement a policy that is not scientifically
						sound, or founded on incorrect science. The organization could critique that piece of legislation, but it will not critique the party that proposed.
						<br><br>5. What are you going to do with money that I donate?
						<br>First, we are going that thank you for your support! Money from donations will be used to conduct all sorts of activities to educate and advocate for science.
						<br><br>6. What kinds of activities will this organization have?
						<br>In keeping with our goals of advocacy and education, we will be hosting events where people can come meet and interact with scientists. We’re going to hold informative seminars and workshops to let people know about issues facing Georgia. For
						example, we may hold an event where people can come learn about how to help stop the spread of Zika, and then meet with public health officials afterwards to learn more about the science and the people who do it.
