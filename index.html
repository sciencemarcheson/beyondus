										<h2 class="major">FAQ</h2>
										<p>                                            
<b>1. How can I get involved?<br></b>
Sign up <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BkYjxvhpbrfoD7Xt2"><b>here</b></a>. In the coming weeks we will be recruiting volunteers, and others who want to get involved, through multiple channels. Be sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for updates.<br></p>
<b>2. What kind of organization will you be? <br></b>
We’re in the process of becoming a 501(c)3. Our chief objectives will be to educate on and advocate for science and data-driven approaches to problems that the state of Georgia faces. We will not be endorsing or even scoring candidates for political office, and will remain nonpartisan.<br>
<b><br>3. What’s the difference between nonpartisan and apolitical?<br></b>
Nonpartisan means that we don’t choose one party over another or endorse one party over another. However, this does not mean we can’t be politically involved. For example, a piece of legislation could implement a policy that is not scientifically sound, or founded on incorrect science. The organization could critique that piece of legislation, but it will not critique the party that proposed.<br>
<b><br>4. What are you going to do with money that I donate?<br></b>
First, we are going that thank you for your support! Money from donations will be used to conduct all sorts of activities to educate and advocate for science.<br>
<b><br>5. What kinds of activities will this organization have?<br></b>
In keeping with our goals of advocacy and education, we will be hosting events where people can come meet and interact with scientists. We’re going to hold informative seminars and workshops to let people know about issues facing Georgia. For example, we may hold an event where people can come learn about how to help stop the spread of Zika, and then meet with public health officials afterwards to learn more about the science and the people who do it.<br>
